				<p>For the testing, we asked 5 classmates to have a look at the website.
				As supporting material we used the <a href="https://github.com/WouterMaas/summit/tree/TESTING" target="_blank">draft of our website</a> for the testing.</p>

		<section class="row">
			<h3 class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4">Method</h3>
			<div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-8">
				<p>We showed the draft of our website to the people we used for the testing by sending them a mail via teams. They had a look at it themselves
					while could follow their actions through their shared screens.</p>
				<p>Questions we asked them were about the overall impression of the design of the website, how easy it is for them to navigate through the 
					first page and if it sparks interest in them.</p>

		<section class="row">
			<h3 class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4">Results</h3>
			<div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-8">
				<p>Most of the feedback we got was positive. One point that was mentioned a lot was that the nav bar is clearly visible because of the big contrast. 
					This made it for the testing subjects very easy to navigate through the website. There were a few comments about not adding more colour however,
					to keep it this clear. However, there were two main points of improvement mentioned.</p>
				<ol> 
					<li>There were a lot of white/empty space on the home page. As this is basically the overview of all the rubrics of the website, testing subjects 
						saw it as a bit disturbing that they need to scroll down a lot to reach the next segment.</li>
					<li>When testing the responsiveness, the spaces were causing some unhandy display of text. Most of the testing subjects also gave the tip to create
						a small white frame on the left and right side of the text as the text looked very pressed, especially on phone mode.</li>
				</ol>

			<h3 class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-4">Recommendations</h3>
			<div class="col-12 col-md-6 col-lg-8">
				<p>Out of the testing, we formulated a few recommendations for our preceeding in building the website.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Stick to a coherent and clear colour code with good contrast for the rest of the pages.</li>
					<li>Make sure to not use too big spaces especially on the front page to keep it overviewable.</li>
					<li>Add a white frame around the text in any size of screen for a better design.</li>
				</ul>
