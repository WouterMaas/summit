					Summit was created to tackle a big problem in The Netherlands' society: overpreasured students. Dutch students spend a great deal of their time in studying and working, while at the same time they have to figure out what they want to do with their future. These kind of decisions can put a lot of preasure on them, more than they're already experiencing. This is a serious issue that can cause some significant mental distress to a new and upcoming generation in the workfield, which is what Summit wants to prevent from happening. Our team consists of five students who study Creative Business on Breda University of Applied Sciences in The Netherlands. We can all relate with our target group, as we're currently going through the same process. Setting up Summit was a big challenge for us as well, as we sometimes struggle with the same problems that we're trying to improve. But with the vision we've had in mind and the strong teamwork and communication, we managed to set up a platform where students and young adults can talk and vent about whatever difficult circumstances they're dealing with. Summit was a great learning experience for us, and we work hard to succeed in our mission: to support these overpressured students.

					We at Summit believe everyone should have the ability to make difficult decitions with ease, and that people shouldn't be judged by rushed mistakes. We do everything we can to provide a safe platform for students to seek for support, advice, esteem, healing, and venting. We believe that we can achieve this by creating a community among these students on our forum, and by providing them extra support if needed through personal coaching. We believe that providing students with a platform like Summit will help them feel happier and self-esteemed in their daily life, finding a clear picture of their goals and achieving them, and to make tough decisions with ease.
