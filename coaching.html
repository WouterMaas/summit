	<h3>Services</h3>
		<span class="align-middle">
			 The services that summit provides can vary depending on the commodity and availability of the client. As a starter, we offer a large supportive online community where people can join and share their experiences. Everybody has the chance to participate and be involved in giving their comments and receiving them as well. We also hope to get a more extensive community in the future. Additionally, the client can get a more personalized service in which they can get direct help with a professional coach face-to-face; thus, it is possible to monitor and see the client's development more thoroughly.

  <div class="row pt-5 pb-5">

      <h3>Face2face</h3>
		We offer Customers are offered 1 free introduction meeting to talk about possible solutions / working ways, as well as what do they need / what can we offer? Then, the first 2 sessions will be half the prize. After those two sessions, weâ€™ll charge a fixed price per session (face-face / video call). These sessions will be charged every month / quarter of the year.
		</span>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-6">
		<span class="align-middle">
			<h3>Online</h3>
      The online service we provide is a more generalized platform where our client can type about their issues or concerns, which will be publicly published. The professional coaches and the Summit community can reply to this post by giving advice, tips, and general feedback to the participant to guide them through their process. The cost of this will be included in the "basic starter pack" fee.
